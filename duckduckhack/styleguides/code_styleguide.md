# DuckDuckHack - Code Style Guide

In any large open-source project, maintainability is required, so a set of style rules is a must to keep clean, readable code.

## General

+ All DuckDuckHack code should be formatted to an indent level of four spaces (that is, configure your editor to insert four spaces when you hit the tab button. This might be called a "soft-tab"). If you need to change a file to fix this, keep that change in its own commit.
+ Comments are a Good Thing<sup>TM</sup>. Let's have more of those!
+ Commit messages should be concise and informative. They are generally in the form `InstantAnswer: changed colors to match mockup`. If the specific commit fixes a bug on GitHub, note that by saying `fixes #123`, where `123` is the issue number (this automatically closes the issue when your pull request is merged). 

## Javascript
**We generally adhere to Crockford's Code Conventions: http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html**. Most importantly:

+ Be sure to follow the closure structure listed [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/spice/spice_basic_tutorial.md#npm-spice---frontend-javascript). The canonical structure is as follows: 

```javascript
(function(env){
    "use strict";
    env.ddg_spice_name = function(){
        ...
        Spice.add({
            ...
        });
    }

    // private functions here
    function doSomething(){
        ...
    }

    // handlebars helpers here
    Spice.registerHelper("name", function(){
        ...
    });
}(this));
```

+ We use semicolons everywhere for consistency.
+ Use the ["One True Brace Style"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS) (opening brace on the same line)
+ Use `{}` instead of `new Object()`, and `[]` instead of `new Array()`.
+ Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`. [Why?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/359509/1998450)
+ We're using ECMAScript's [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FFunctions_and_function_scope%2FStrict_mode), so you'll need to declare every variable with `var`. Chaining these like so is encouraged, with one line per variable.

```javascript
var foo = 1,
    bar = true;
```

+ We try to support all modern browsers, including IE 8. As such, please remember the following:
    + Trailing commas in objects will not work.

    ```javascript
    var foo = {
        a: 'b',
        c: 42, //<-- BAD
    };
    ```
    
    + `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()` will not work. Consider using the jQuery equivalents [`$.map()`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/) and [`$.each()`](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/).
+ Don't modify a native object's prototype, as this takes global effect. Consider using local functions instead.
+ Objects are better defined all at once:

```javascript
//prefer this:
var foo = {
    a: 'b',
    c: 42
};

//over this:
var bar = {};
bar.a = 'b';
bar.c = 42;
```

+ If you're using a jQuery selector many times, it's best to assign it to a variable.

```javascript
//prefer this:
var $text_element = $('#text_element');
$text_element.show();
$text_element.html('abc');

//over this:
$('#text_element').show();
$('#text_element').html('abc');
```

## Handlebars

The goal here is to ensure the Handlebars template is easy to read and understand. Please:

+ Put nested elements on new lines:

```html
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#">link text</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            <a href="#">other link text</a>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
```

## CSS

+ All CSS should be "namespaced" with the container element (usually `.zci--spicename` for Spices and `.zci--answer` for Goodies).

```css
.zci--stopwatch .spice-pane {
    ...
}
```

+ Put selectors on multiple lines.

```css
.zci--stopwatch .spice-pane,
.zci--stopwatch .spice-pane-right {
    ...
}
```

+ Please no inline CSS. For Goodies, we prefer a separate share file that can be slurped in. [Example](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/7a4d762f3f694ea1d9f1d93b49b4b80b32165da4/lib/DDG/Goodie/Conversions.pm#L62)
