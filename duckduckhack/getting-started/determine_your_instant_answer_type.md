# Determine Your Instant Answer Type

## Choose an Instant Answer

Before you begin building anything, you'll need to know what kind of instant answer it is that you want to work on. You can get some instant answer ideas on our [ideas forum](https://dukgo.com/ideas).

## Determine Instant Answer Source

Now that you know which queries you'd like to show an instant answer for, you'll need to determine what the source for your instant answer will be.

Most instant answers rely on some type of data source. However, some are able to provide their instant answer without using any external sources. An example would be a string manipulation instant answer which would only require the use of a function to return an answer.

Please use the following flowchart to help you to determine which kind of instant answer you'll be creating. Your instant answer type will be based on the date source your instant answer will be using:

If you were able to determine which instant answer type you will be using, please continue below to fork the repository so you can begin coding!

If the right instant answer type is still not obvious, don't worry. The DuckDuckGo community is here for you! Please visit our [instant answer idea forum](https://dukgo.com/forum) and post a new thread for your instant answer. Be sure to describe the instant answer you have in mind, and don't forget to indicate where you think the date should come from. Someone from the community or the DuckDuckGo team will be able to help you determine the best course of action for you.

**Note:** Sometimes more than one instant answer type can work (depending on the data source), and we can help you figure out which one would work best. As always, you can reach us in the [forum](https://dukgo.com/forum), the [DuckDuckHack e-mail list](https://www.listbox.com/subscribe/?list_id=197814), or you can chat with us on our [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=duckduckgo).

Before moving forward, you **must** know which instant answer type you will be using. From this point onwards, the documentation will be specific to each instant answer type.

## Fork the Instant Answer Repository

**Hang on:** We're going to be using a piece of software called Git here. If you're not familiar with it, you can learn more about it on [Try Git](http://try.github.com/). When you're done with that, you can start [setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer. Feel free to click on one of those links. Don't worry--we won't be going anywhere.

Now that you know the instant answer type that you'll be using, you'll have to fork the right repository that you're going to work on ([GitHub instructions](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)) so you can start coding. You'll need a GitHub account for this one. This is required because we use GitHub to handle all incoming *Pull Requests* (code modifications) and *Issues* (bug reports) which cannot be made without a GitHub account.

Once you have an account, please fork the appropriate repository:

- For **Goodies**, [click here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/)

- For **Spice**, [click here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/)
